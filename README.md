# Plan of Action (POA) Application

## Overview

The Plan of Action (POA) application is a comprehensive planning and productivity management tool designed to streamline daily work planning, approval processes, and performance tracking. It allows employees to submit detailed daily work plans, which then go through a structured approval workflow involving team leads and managers.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login system with role-based access (Manager, Team Lead, SDE, JSDE, Intern, Admin)
- **Daily Plan Submission**: Employees can create daily plans with deliverables totaling 8 hours
- **Multi-level Approval Workflow**: Plans go through Team Lead and Manager approvals
- **Plan Revision**: Employees can revise plans that need rework
- **Performance Tracking**: Track on-time vs. delayed deliverables
- **Project Management**: Create and manage projects with team assignments
- **Temporary Manager Assignment**: Assign temporary managers for projects when needed
- **Responsive Dashboard**: Role-specific dashboards with relevant metrics and visualizations

## Application Workflow

1. **Plan Creation**:
   - Employee creates a plan for a specific date with deliverables totaling exactly 8 hours
   - Each deliverable must not exceed 3 hours
   - Plans for the current day must be submitted before 11:00 AM

2. **Approval Process**:
   - Team Lead reviews the plan first
   - If approved by Team Lead, the plan is forwarded to the Manager
   - Manager makes the final decision (Approve, Reject, or Request Rework)

3. **Plan Status**:
   - Pending: Awaiting approval
   - Approved: Plan accepted by both Team Lead and Manager
   - Rejected: Plan declined
   - Needs Rework: Plan requires revision and resubmission

4. **Work Logging**:
   - Employees log actual time spent on deliverables
   - Work logs must be submitted before 11:00 PM

## User Roles

- **Employee (SDE, JSDE, Intern)**: Create plans, log work, view personal performance
- **Team Lead**: Approve team members' plans, create personal plans, view team performance
- **Manager**: Final approval authority, create projects, manage team members
- **Admin**: User management, system-wide access

## Development Architecture

The application is built with:

- **React**: Front-end UI library
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **ShadCN UI**: Component library for consistent design
- **React Router**: For navigation and routing
- **Context API**: For state management

## State Management

The application uses React's Context API with custom hooks:

- `AuthContext`: Manages user authentication state
- `DataContext`: Central data management for plans, projects, users
- Custom utility hooks:
  - `usePlanUtils`: Plan-related operations
  - `useProjectUtils`: Project management functions
  - `useUserUtils`: User management capabilities

## Building and Extending

### Adding New Features

1. Define the data model in `src/types/index.ts`
2. Create utility functions in the relevant utility file
3. Expose the functionality through the appropriate context
4. Build UI components and pages to interact with the new features

### Customizing the Approval Workflow

The approval workflow can be modified in `src/context/data/planUtils.ts`:

- Change approval roles or sequence
- Add additional approval steps
- Modify time constraints
